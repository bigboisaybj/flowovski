  In a world where 99% of all species become extinct, we’ve certainly come a long way from our humble beginnings nearly 200,000 years ago.
  That’s not to say it hasn’t been without challenges. <br><br>

  135,000 years ago in Africa, our ancestors were amidst in an unforgiving drought. Their numbers dropped from 10,000 to possibly 600.
  All future generations of humans stemmed from this band of survivors.<br><br>

  Consequently, humans have less genetic diversity than single troupe of West African chimpanzees.
  And yet, this rigidity in our biology has only opened more doors than those it’s closed.
  Like so much in nature, there is so much confusion, hypocrisy but perfect rhythmic chaos.<br><br>

  Our evolution from 200,000 years ago marked a never-before seen inflexion point that saw humans start
  engineering their own future. No longer were we just a pawn and since then, as almost in acknowledgment to our beginnings,
  we’ve sought to build our own worlds.<br><br>

  It’s a fascinating story and just as in the past, there’s no doubt still plenty of challenges and turns ahead.
  Whatever drives this craftsmanship is another question entirely,
  but what is written clearly is the need for tools to progress through the following chapters.<br><br>

  The oldest stone tools date from 3.3 million years. If you recall, our beginnings date 200,000 years ago and so again,
   we are reminded of our once primitive selves. Just like your recollections of your primitive teenage behaviour,
   we too have existed in perhaps a more foreboding way than we’d like to remember.<br><br>

  Undeniably though, a comparison between our ancient, tool-bearing ancestors,
  the Kenyanthropus playops against our 21st-Century selves is mind-boggling. But this change is manufactured.<br><br>

  Without artificial intervention, we’re susceptible to even the most trivial of dangers. When a band of determined engineers
  “poisoned” Chicago’s water-supply with chlorine in 1908, their clean drinking water led to a 43% reduction in total mortality
  in the average American city, and a 74% reduction in infant mortality. Without man-made intervention,
  we’re gravely limited in what we can do.<br><br>

  The case for advancing human functionality has always been obvious and so has the demand for the appropriate tools.<br><br>

  But just our inflexion point nearly 200,000 years ago that saw us break from the herd and craft our own paths,
  we are quickly approaching another inflexion point but one that has the stark distinction of being ever-lasting.<br><br>

  Humans are biological creations. Our Achilles heel is exactly that - biology. Our evolutionary path is a series of steps
  away from dependence on this biology.<br><br>

  This path includes the inevitable step of breaking past this biological barrier and transitioning from a complete biological
  pecies to a digitally-supported one.<br><br>

  While progress has been impressive within biomedical fields, there has been proportionally. little to complement the
  most important aspect of humanity - the way we think. It’s important to develop artificial limbs and create vaccines
  that curb viruses, but there remains two important steps that have yet to see radical progress: <br><br>

  - Emulate human consciousness,<br>
  - Improve human consciousness.<br><br>

  Consciousness is arguably the framework that precipitated our 21st-Century for the way it is today.
  This has been built with the tools we have today, but for the 22nd-Century and beyond, we need tools that our
  effectively ourselves.<br><br>

  We need tools to think like us.<br><br>

  We need to extend consciousness to machines. Not necessarily to make the type of artificial intelligence that is
  discussed today (that is trivial by comparison), but instead to make the consciousness we need for the next evolutionary step.<br><br>

  The step that’ll see us break away from our biological roots and into our self-made forms.<br><br>

  Naturally, this is a multi-step process or, to at least make some effort in adhering to the title’s theme, a degustation.<br><br>

  The first step is to have a tool that that we have first-hand control over. This tool needs to be one that is reflective of modern and
  future tools - in this case, software. Additionally, to maximise usability, this tool should be one that has frequent
  engagement and room to become essentially conscious.<br><br>

  Specifically, this is a food-ordering service with the intention of becoming a predictive machine that can provide a
  range of services to its users. Just like the fundamentality of consciousness to humans, so to is eating and drinking.<br><br>

  The resources our food-ordering service provides will be necessary in financing and complementing our research.
  This company is not just a research centre - it provides products to consumers and so in this spirit,
  Bright intends on releasing a range of products that are representative of our progress in creating artificial consciousness.<br><br>

  This portfolio of products will be complementary and are not restricted to software. Just like how thought powers human form,
   so too will our progress. While the nature of these products aren’t confirmed, their general form and purpose have already been
   designed.<br><br>

  Just as fundamental as eating and drinking is, so to are the future products. Each one inheriting the functionality of its
  predecessor and extending the general capability of the user.  This will not be a multi-year plan, perhaps not even a
  multi-decade plan, in fact it’s most-likely a multi-generational plan.<br><br>

  Simply put, Bright’s goal is to extend the functionality of every single human. Reduce the dependency on tools and
  other non-human abilities.<br><br>

  A future in the hands of those humans is an incredible idea. It’ll be a future without the restraints of today.<br><br>

  The inflexion point we last passed was the ability to craft our world.<br><br>

  The next inflexion point is being capable of building worlds from scratch.<br><br>
